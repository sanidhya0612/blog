                    Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.

                    The National Green Tribunal (NGT) imposed penalty of ₹52 crore on Udupi Power Corporation Ltd. (UPCL), part of Adani Power, for violating environmental laws and polluting its surroundings at Nandikur near Padubidri in Udupi district, Karnataka.

                    On May 31, Judicial Member K. Ramakrishnan and expert members Satyagopal Korlapati and Vijay Kulkarni of NGT’s southern bench in Chennai said the environmental compensation was being levied on the ‘Polluter Pays’ principle.

                    Developed countries should share technology and collaborate with developing countries and a fresh look must be taken at the global intellectual property rights regime, said Mr. Yadav who was chairing a session at the Stockholm Conference in Sweden on Wednesday.
